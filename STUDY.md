# Calculator

In this folder is a calculator application written in HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

As a guide, it should take around an hour to complete all tasks.


## Tasks
- Can you limit the length of input to 15 digits?
- Can you implement the clear function (C)
- Can you write the logic in the `calculate` function to handle the operation inputs (Divide, Multiply, Subtract, Add)?
- Can you update the results display to align the digits to the right (like a real calculator)?


## Bonus tasks
- Can you update the page to take keyboard input
- Can you update the calculator logic to handle complex chains of operations? For example, add 2 values together and then divide the output by 2
